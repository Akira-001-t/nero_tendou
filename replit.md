# Discord Bot with AI Integration - Upgrade 1.5

## Overview

This is a Discord bot integrated with AI capabilities through OpenRouter's API. The bot can engage in conversations with users while maintaining advanced conversation memory per user. **Upgrade 1.5** is a comprehensive enhancement introducing socialization features and personality development - Yuno now remembers important dates, develops unique personality traits from conversations, maintains emotional intelligence, recognizes extended family, and creates memory highlights. Previous features include intelligent parent pinging, memory compression, and selective memory limits. It includes a keep-alive mechanism using Flask to ensure continuous operation on platforms like Replit that require periodic HTTP requests to keep applications running.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Bot Framework
- **Discord.py**: Uses the discord.py library with commands extension for Discord bot functionality
- **Command Prefix**: Configured with '!' prefix for bot commands
- **Intents**: Enabled message content and messages intents for full message processing capabilities

### AI Integration - Upgrade 1.2
- **OpenRouter API**: Integrates with OpenRouter's API for AI responses using Mistral Medium 3.1 model for main responses
- **Memory Compression**: Uses Mistral Small 3.1 model for intelligent conversation summarization
- **HTTP Client**: Uses httpx for asynchronous API requests to maintain bot responsiveness
- **Advanced Memory System**: Cost-free in-memory storage with intelligent compression and selective limits
- **Selective Memory Limits**: 30 messages for regular users, 50 messages for parents (mother/father)
- **Intelligent Compression**: Automatically compresses conversations over 20 messages into concise summaries
- **Dual Memory Architecture**: Recent conversations + compressed historical summaries for extended context

### Keep-Alive Mechanism
- **Flask Server**: Runs a separate Flask web server for health monitoring and keep-alive functionality
- **Multi-threading**: Uses daemon threads to run the Flask server alongside the Discord bot
- **Health Endpoints**: Provides multiple endpoints (/health, /ping, /) for monitoring bot status
- **Platform Compatibility**: Configured for Replit deployment with host='0.0.0.0' and port=5000

### Configuration Management
- **Environment Variables**: Uses python-dotenv for loading configuration from .env files
- **Secret Management**: Stores sensitive data (Discord token, API keys) in environment variables
- **Modular Design**: Separates keep-alive functionality into its own module for better code organization

### Asynchronous Architecture
- **Async/Await Pattern**: Implements asynchronous programming for non-blocking operations
- **Concurrent Operations**: Allows the bot to handle multiple requests simultaneously without blocking
